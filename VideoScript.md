# Intro and Data:
## (SLIDE: Title and pictures of the 3 of us)
*Jonathan:* Hello, our group set out to look at Americans’ attitudes toward Climate Change – specifically, whether those attitudes correlate with Population Density.  Our group members are Elena Tsvetkova, Anita Taucher, and I’m Jonathan Shakes.

## SLIDE: YALE WEBSITE
*Jonathan:* Some of our data comes from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communications. They ask survey questions like, “Do you think climate change is happening,” or “Do you think your state governor should be doing more about climate change?” 

On top of the Yale data, we add census data about population density, to see if that’s a predictor of people’s climate change attitudes.

We also added election return data from the 2016 presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. I guess the Yale program folks want to downplay the politics, because they don’t publish their data with a political overlay. Their FAQ did say population density would be an interesting angle they had not followed.

## SLIDE: Side-by-side rows from two different data sets
*Jonathan:* Before we could do any analysis, we had to merge the data at the county level. You’d think that would be easy, right? There used to be a standard code for counties called a FIPS code, but in 2008 the commerce department replaced with another standard called INCITS, and our sources were inconsistent. It’s not practical to manually check that 3000 counties match correctly.   So we wrote python functions that translate each coding standard into the one we used, then used that as an index to combine datasets.

# TESTING (60 words)

# CONCLUSION (100 words)
*Jonathan:* Our hypothesis was that climate-change-related attitudes in dense cities will be significantly different than those in rural areas. 
This is an important question because humans are migrating towards cities, and if people in cities “lose touch” with the importance of protecting the environment, that could impact the political will to protect the environmental, especially in a democracy.
